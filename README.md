# RoboticsIK-ANN
This repository features an ANN-based approach for solving the inverse kinematics of the IRB 140 industrial robot, comparing direct and sequential methods. The project includes an offline Streamlit-based webpage with an interactive 3D simulation created in Blender and displayed using Node.js 3.
